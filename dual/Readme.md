## displaying duals of uniform star polyhedra

The dual.py program draws pictures of, among others, the duals of uniform star polyhedra, from the following input data:

- The number of vertices per face. This is equal to the number of normals of the polyhedron of which the dual is taken. In some cases, this number can be reduced using a bigger symmetry group
(including reflection)

- Normals of the polyhedron of which the dual is taken

- The color, as a 3 byte RGB value

- A vertex of the polyhedron of which the dual is taken

- The symmetry group

The program works as follows: for each pair of conecutive normals (of the original polyhedron) a triangle is generated using the make_triangle function. For each triangle a number of new triangles
is generated by applying the elements of the symmetry group. The triangle data is written to a PLY file (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)>). The contents of this file are then
displayed using open3d. A large number of example input files is supplied

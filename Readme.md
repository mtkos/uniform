## uniform star polyhedra

This repository contains a set of small Python programs related to uniform star polyhedra. The vertex map contains programs to obtain exact coordinates of, among others,
the non-snub uniform star polyhedra. By 'exact' I mean symbolic expressions, no numerical approximation. The star and dual maps contain programs for displaying these polyhedra, using
open3d
